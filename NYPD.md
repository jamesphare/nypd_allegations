Allegations Against the NYPD
================

Following a change to the New York law that kept police officers’
disciplinary records secret—and amid an ongoing lawsuit—ProPublica has
released a [searchable
database](https://projects.propublica.org/nypd-ccrb/) of complaints to
to the Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB). The database, which can
be downloaded in its entirety
[here](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/civilian-complaints-against-new-york-city-police-officers),
includes allegations against the nearly 4,000 officers who have at least
one substantiated complaint against them. The CCRB’s powers are
extremely circumscribed, and these data reflect its
[limitations](https://www.propublica.org/article/nypd-civilian-complaint-review-board-editors-note).
The CCRB “exonerates” officers whose conduct is ruled to fall within
departmental guidelines, no matter how egregious. Allegations may remain
“unsubstantiated” due to a routine lack of NYPD cooperation (in
violation of the law). Even “substantiated” allegations lead only to
suggestions, which the department is free to ignore.

Even a quick glance through these records turns up numerous officers who
have faced repeated, serious misconduct allegations while rising through
the ranks. But first, it’s worth looking at these data from a bird’s eye
view. Anyone who is familiar with New York City would not expect police
misconduct—and thus complaints about police misconduct—to be evenly
distributed geographically, and that is the case here.

The most substantiated complaints by far are found in the seventy-fifth
precinct in East New York, Brooklyn, the location of a major corruption
scandal, but nearby neighborhoods in Brooklyn also see a
disproportionate number of complaints, as does the South Bronx. This
looks like a map of over-policing minoritized communities.

The ProPublica database records the ethinicity of both the complainant
and the accused officer.

A majority of officers who have substantiated complaints against them
are white while, in cases where the ethnicity is known, a majority of
complainants are Black.
